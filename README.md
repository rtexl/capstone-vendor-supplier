# VendorLens AI

VendorLens is an AI-assisted supplier onboarding application. It turns registration, tax, and insurance documents into an auditable review workflow while keeping the final approval decision with a human reviewer.

## What it does

- Creates supplier cases and accepts one document in each required category.
- Extracts selectable PDF text, redacts PII before AI calls, and stores supplier-scoped ChromaDB embeddings.
- Uses OpenRouter when configured, with Azure OpenAI as the configuration fallback, for structured extraction, embeddings, and cited document Q&A.
- Shows confidence, source pages, conflicts, compliance checks, and editable fields.
- Records approval or rejection decisions and a mock ERP handoff in PostgreSQL.

## Architecture

```text
React + Material UI
        |
     FastAPI
        |
Document text extraction -> PII redaction -> OpenRouter or Azure AI
        |                                  |
   PostgreSQL                         ChromaDB
        |                                  |
Compliance rules + audit trail -> human decision -> ERP handoff
```

Langfuse traces AI calls, Promptfoo evaluates answer quality, and Prometheus exposes application metrics.

## Run with Docker (recommended for a fresh clone)

1. Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env`.
2. Add either an OpenRouter key or the existing Azure OpenAI settings.
3. Run `docker compose up --build -d` from the repository root.
4. Open the prototype workspaces in separate tabs:
   - Supplier portal: `http://localhost:5173/supplier`
   - Reviewer workspace: `http://localhost:5173/reviewer`

See [DOCKER_SETUP.md](DOCKER_SETUP.md) for the complete first-clone guide, verification commands, data-volume behavior, and troubleshooting.

## Run natively

1. Configure `backend/.env` with PostgreSQL and ChromaDB settings, then configure either OpenRouter or Azure OpenAI as described below.
2. Start the API: `cd backend; .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload`.
3. Start the UI in another terminal: `cd frontend; npm run dev`.
4. Open the Vite URL shown in the terminal.

See [MONITORING_SETUP.md](MONITORING_SETUP.md) for the three monitoring and evaluation tools.

## AI provider selection

Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` to route document extraction, embeddings, supplier Q&A, and the general assistant through OpenRouter. OpenRouter model IDs are configured independently with `OPENROUTER_EXTRACTION_MODEL`, `OPENROUTER_ANSWER_MODEL`, and `OPENROUTER_EMBEDDING_MODEL`.

When `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is empty or absent, the backend uses the existing Azure `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`, and Azure deployment-name settings. Restart FastAPI after changing provider settings because the client is cached for the process lifetime.

Provider selection is configuration-based. A failed OpenRouter request does not retry through Azure, which prevents an outage, invalid key, or quota failure from silently sending supplier data to a different provider.

The default OpenRouter embedding model is the same `text-embedding-3-small` family used by Azure. If you select an embedding model with a different vector size, recreate the local Chroma data and reprocess every supplier before asking document questions.
